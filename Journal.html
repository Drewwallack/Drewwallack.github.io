		Hello! Welcome to my CS1 journal, which I will fill with information on all of my future projects. My first one, of course, is building the website that will house these projects. So far I have built the menu bar for my website and have learned a lot about HTML- like how to group divs, tag them, and wrap links around them, and even more in CSS- like how to style tagged items with color, font, size, and transitions. Specifically, I have enjoyed learning how to make elements change when they are hovered over as I have displayed in my menu bar that enlarges and changes font when hovered over. I feel fairly confident in the information I have learned already, and am ready to build the bulk of my website. I am excited to finish my website and add interactive elements in the next week or two.

		Hello! This week, I finished my journal page (the page you are on right now) and I started my first project, a birthday card, which is linked in the "projects" section of my website. I feel relatively confident with the standard html divisions and in CSS, I am learning new style criteria every day as I add to my website. I am not too confident with CSS animations, but it seems like a skill that I will get better at in the near future. For my first CSS animation, I contributed to my birthday card for my dog and made a title that changed colors and sizes to simulate the amuesment park vibe. For the rest of the card, I want to make an interactive wheel that spins to reveal what my dog gets: a treat, a walk, steak, turkey, or nothing. Thats all for now.
